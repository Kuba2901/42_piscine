## Introduction

Hello! I'm jnenczak, and this repository contains my work from the 42Piscine bootcamp. 42Piscine is an intense and immersive program designed to test and develop problem-solving skills, proficiency in C programming, and familiarity with Unix systems.

## Projects

### Shell00

Shell00 includes basic shell exercises, introducing us to the Unix command line, file system navigation, and basic shell scripting.

### Shell01

Shell01 builds on the previous module, covering more advanced shell scripting techniques and Unix commands.

### C00 - C11

These projects range from C00 to C11 and cover various fundamental concepts in C programming:
- **C00**: Introduction to C and basic syntax.
- **C01**: Memory allocation and manipulation.
- **C02**: Arrays and strings.
- **C03**: Functions and recursion.
- **C04**: Pointers and addresses.
- **C05**: More advanced pointer usage.
- **C06**: File I/O operations.
- **C07**: Linked lists and data structures.
- **C08**: Memory management.
- **C09**: Algorithmic problem solving.
- **C10**: Advanced algorithms and data structures.
- **C11**: Final project combining all learned concepts.
- **C12**: Linked Lists.
